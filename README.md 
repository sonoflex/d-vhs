We are a group of friends who have rediscovered our love of physical media. We buy DVDs again, often used, and lend them to each other. The most important criterion for the films is that you want to watch them several times. We call this decentralized video home sharing, D-VHS. We use this small web application so that we know who has which film or who has lent it to whom.
